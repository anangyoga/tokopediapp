        I couldnt get Chelsea out of my head the last few days so Im just happy and relieved that its all done, said Chukwuemeka. Im so excited and just cant wait to get on the pitch, meet all the players and try to win games and trophies

        Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin could miss the opening six weeks of the Premier League season after suffering a knee injury in training. The England international, 25, missed four months last season because of a persistent
        muscle problem. His absence leaves Frank Lampards side light up front after Brazil forward Richarlison joined Tottenham for Â£60m. Losing a player like Dominic going into the first week is obviously going to affect you, Lampard said.
        Well have to work around it and other players will have to step up and do the job. Hopefully six weeks passes relatively quickly and we get Dominic back. Calvert-Lewin, who suffered what Lampard called a freak injury in training,
        was restricted to 18 games last season, scoring five goals, as the Merseysiders avoided relegation by four points. Salomon Rondon, Demarai Gray, Alex Iwobi and Anthony Gordon are the options available for Lampard up front. We
        obviously lost Richarlison. He was versatile across the front as well, Lampard said. Were very aware of the areas that we want to strengthen. Going into the first game with Salomon suspended as well makes it pretty clear that that
        might be one of the areas we look at. Everton open their Premier League campaign against Chelsea on Sunday.
